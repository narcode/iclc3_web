Welcome to the **Netherlands Coding Live** mailing list ðŸ’» ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

NL_CL is a space for engaging with Live Coding through practice, experimentation, openess, discussion and performance. 

We organize a series of alterntive live coding sessions exploring a specific topic per session.

Try sending a message to livecode-nl@we.lurk.org to introduce yourself! 

Always feel free to start new discussions and share your thoughts regarding the live coding practice, by either sending a messages to the list via email: livecode-nl@we.lurk.org or by replying to a message you receive from this list.

You can browse past discussion threads, and also reply to them and make new ones, on the 'hyperkitty' web interface:
  https://we.lurk.org/hyperkitty/list/livecode-nl@we.lurk.org/

You can access your settings via postorius:
  https://we.lurk.org/postorius/lists/livecode-nl.we.lurk.org/

For the web-interface you will have to register but this can be done with existing social accounts (gtihub, twitter, etc) or you can create a new one.

WELCOME on behalf of nl_cl
